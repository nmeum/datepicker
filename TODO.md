* Allow passing a specified start day for date selection instead of always using the current date
* Implement `-m` to make Monday the start of a week
* Make amount of columns for `-y` configurable
* Improve cursor movement, differentiate:
	1. Logical movement: prev/next day and prev/next week
	2. Spatial movement: move cursor across month boundaries in view
* Optionally allow specification of seconds in the time view
* Differentiate `-y` and `-Y`, see https://man.archlinux.org/man/cal.1#OPTIONS
