## README

An [fzf]-like tool to interactively select a date in a provided format.

![Example usage with journalctl(1)](https://files.8pit.net/img/datepicker-demo.gif)

### Motivation

A variety of command-line utilities ([journalctl], [mpick], [khal], â€¦) allow passing dates in different formats via command-line options.
Entering these dates in the required formats manually can be cumbersome and annoying.
Inspired by [fzf], this utility allows visually selecting a date interactively through a TUI, thereby easing specification of dates for other command-line utilities.

### Installation

To install this utility clone the repository and run:

	$ cabal install

### Usage Example

Presently, `datepicker` only supports a single command-line argument: The date format.
This format must be specified using the format strings supported by the [formatTime] function from Haskell's `time` library.
For example, in order to use this utility with [journalctl] you may invoke it as follows:

	$ journalctl --since="$(datepicker '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"

The command-line interface is subject to change, more options will be added shortly.
